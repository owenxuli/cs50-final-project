    <h1>Notation</h1>
    <body>
        By Owen and Daniel John
        <p>In chess, every square has a name. Starting from the left side of the board, in white's perspective, we denote every column starting from a to h, and starting from the bottom we number every row from 1 to 8. We denote the white pieces with capital leter, such as P por pawn, and black pieces with lower letters, such as p for pawn.</p>
        <p>
            In general, chess follows the following notation:
            <ul>
                <li>P: White Pawn</li>
                <li>R: White Rook</li>
                <li>N: White Knight</li>
                <li>B: White Bishop</li>
                <li>Q: White Queen</li>
                <li>K: White King</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="chessboard">
            {% for square in squares %}
                <div class="{{ square.color }}">
                    {{ square.piece }}{{ square.name }}
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
