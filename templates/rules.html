                The rules, often referred to as the laws, that govern chess outline the intricacies of this two-player abstract strategy board game. Played on a chessboard, each participant commands a set of sixteen pieces, each with distinct movements. The ultimate goal is to achieve checkmate—putting the opponent's king in a position where it faces capture with no escape. However, the conclusion of a game can take various routes, including resignation or draw scenarios.

                While the exact origins of chess are shrouded in mystery, the modern rules began taking shape during the Middle Ages and underwent refinements until the early 19th century. Regional variations persisted during this evolution. Presently, FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international chess governing body, establishes standard rules, with minor adaptations by national organizations for specific needs. Different rule sets cater to variations like fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.

                Beyond detailing the fundamental moves of pieces, these rules encompass specifications for equipment, parameters for time control, guidelines for player conduct and ethics, accommodations for physically challenged players, and the recording of moves using chess notation. The comprehensive set also includes provisions for addressing irregularities that may arise during a game, ensuring a fair and enjoyable playing experience.

                        Chess unfolds on a square chessboard, a meticulous grid of 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight configuration, reminiscent of the design seen in draughts. The squares, regardless of their actual hue, are distinguished as either "light" or "white" for the brighter ones and "dark" or "black" for their darker counterparts. At the inception of the game, a set of sixteen pieces, divided into "white" and "black," find their positions on the board. The board's orientation guarantees that each player's near-right corner holds a white square. The rows stretching horizontally bear the name "ranks," while the vertical columns are referred to as "files."

                        At the inception of the game, the chess pieces assume their positions as depicted in the diagram: each side featuring a king, queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and an array of eight pawns. The arrangement is a thoughtful placement of each piece on the board:

                                The player in charge of the white pieces is identified as "White," while the player managing the black pieces is referred to as "Black." White initiates the game by making the first move, after which the players take turns making moves. It is mandatory to make a move; deliberately skipping a turn, even if disadvantageous, is not allowed. The game progresses until a checkmate is achieved, a player voluntarily resigns, or a draw is declared, as elaborated below. Additionally, in games subject to a time control, a player exceeding the time limit loses unless they cannot be checkmated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Official chess rules do not prescribe a specific method for determining who plays as White. Instead, this decision is typically determined by tournament-specific rules (such as those in Swiss system or round-robin tournaments) or, in casual play, through mutual agreement. In instances of mutual agreement, a common practice is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in their hands, allowing the other player to choose a hand. The revealed piece determines the color assigned to the choosing player.

                                        Every chess piece has a unique way of moving. When making a move, a piece can advance to an empty square, except when capturing an adversary's piece. With the exceptions of knight moves and castling, pieces are unable to leap over other pieces on the board. A piece is considered captured or taken when an opposing piece attacks and occupies its square. Once captured, the piece is permanently removed from the game. It's worth noting that while the king can be placed in check, it cannot be captured.

                                            <li2>- The king moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A special move with the king known as castling is allowed only once per player, per game.</li2>
                                            <li2>- A rook moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically. It also is moved when castling.</li2>
                                            <li2>- A bishop moves any number of vacant squares diagonally. (Thus a bishop can move to only light or dark squares, not both.)</li2>
                                            <li2>- The queen moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li2>
                                            <li2>- A knight moves to one of the nearest squares not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an "L" pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces; it jumps to the new location.</li2>
                                            <li2>- Pawns have the most complex rules of movement:</li2>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li2>- A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.</li2>
                                                <li2>- A pawn, unlike other pieces, captures differently from how it moves. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn. It cannot move to those squares when vacant except when capturing en passant.</li2>
                                            </ul>

                                        Castling is accomplished by moving the king two squares towards a rook and then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it. The simultaneous movement of both the king and rook is not allowed, as it must adhere to the principle that "Each move must be played with one hand only." An unmoved king and an unmoved rook of the same color on the same rank are said to have castling rights. Castling is only permissible if the following conditions are met:

                                        If a pawn moves two squares during its initial move and lands adjacent to an enemy pawn on the same rank, the enemy pawn has the option to capture it en passant as if the pawn had moved only one square. This en passant capture is permissible only on the move immediately following the pawn's advance. The diagrams illustrate an example: if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can execute an en passant capture, moving from b4 to a3, resulting in the removal of the white pawn on a4 from the board.

                                        When a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn undergoes promotion or conversion to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color, as selected by the player (with the queen being the typical choice). The player's selection is not constrained by pieces previously captured. Consequently, in theory, a player could have as many as nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights, provided all their pawns are promoted. If the preferred piece is unavailable, the player must summon the arbiter to provide the necessary piece.

                                        A king is deemed to be in check if it is threatened by at least one opposing piece. Even if a piece is immobilized due to the risk of putting its own king in check (pinned against its king), it can still impose a check on the opponent. Making a move that exposes or maintains one's king in check is forbidden. If it is not possible to get out of check, the king is checkmated and the game is over. To extricate oneself from a check, the available options include:

                                                The illustration depicts a checkmate scenario. The black queen poses a threat to the white king, and the vacant square to which the king might move is also under threat. Moreover, the king is unable to capture the queen since doing so would subject it to a check from the rook.

                                                When a player's king is under threat of check, and there exists no valid move that the player can execute to evade check, the king is declared checkmated. This results in the conclusion of the game, and the player facing checkmate is the loser. It's noteworthy that, in contrast to the other pieces, the king is never captured.

                                                Players have the option to resign at any point in the game, and in adherence to USCF Rules, this act concedes victory to the opponent. Resignation can be communicated verbally or indicated on the score sheet in three manners: (1) by writing "resigns," (2) by circling the game's result, or (3) by noting "1–0" if Black resigns or "0–1" if White resigns. Tipping over the king is also a sign of resignation, but it should be distinguished from accidentally knocking the king over. Ceasing both clocks doesn't necessarily indicate resignation, as clocks can be stopped to call the arbiter. Although an offer of a handshake is sometimes employed, it may be misinterpreted as a draw offer.

                                                In accordance with FIDE Laws, if one player resigns, the result is a draw if the opponent has no means to achieve checkmate through any legal sequence of moves. Otherwise, it results in a loss for the resigning player.

Despite occasional instances where players continue in such situations, the established rules of chess dictate that the game is promptly concluded the moment a dead position emerges on the board. These dead positions can be classified into two types:

This outcome applies unless the opponent is incapable of achieving checkmate. Various forms of time control exist, where a player may have a predetermined total time for the entire game or be required to execute a specific number of moves within a set time frame. Additionally, a minor time increment may be granted for each move executed.
