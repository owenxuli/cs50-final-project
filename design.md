# Project Design

## homepage.html

This site contains a table listing some of our own favorite chess openings. If you click on each of the openings, you will be redirected to a website (wikipedia) where you can find more information about the history and general information on the opening. This page also contains information about which color chooses to initiate the opening, and how many main variations of the opening exist. Under this table, there is a seemingly normal chessboard, however, we have eliminated all the legal functions that is chess rules, so you can try to drag pieces around in anyway you want! Once, you are satisfied with your position, you can click the restart button underneath which will revert the board back to its original position.
