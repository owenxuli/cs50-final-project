## homepage.html

This site contains a table listing some of our own favorite chess openings. If you click on each of the openings, you will be redirected to a website (not our own) where you can find more information about the history of the opening. This page also contains information about the which color chooses to initiate the opening, and how many variations of the opening exist.
