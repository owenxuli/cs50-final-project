## By Owen Xu Li and Daniel Zhang

Welcome to our CS50 final project! 

Given that both of us are passionate about chess, we decided to combine our interests in chess and programming to develop an educational website that allows users to learn the rules, the notation, and a selection of common chess openings so that they are up and running to play chess matches with other beginners after visiting the site.
